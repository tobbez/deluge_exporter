# Deluge Exporter

Prometheus exporter for the [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) BitTorrent client.


## Requirements

 * Python 2.7 or 3
 * [prometheus\_client](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python)
 * [deluge-client](https://github.com/JohnDoee/deluge-client)


## Notes
### State
The project is generally considered complete. However, there are a number of
areas that could be improved, and contributions are welcome. Some areas that
could use improvements are:

 - [ ] Packaging: There are currently no packaging scripts nor PyPI packages
 - [ ] Configuration


### Configuration
There is currently no explicit configuration. The Deluge Exporter currently
expects to be run under the same user account as the deluge daemon, and
extracts the connection details from Deluge's configuration files.

The exporter listens on port 9354.

### Per-torrent metrics
Per-torrent metrics are not included by design. They are not particularly
useful, and would cause series bloat.

A contribution adding them would be accepted assuming it would be opt-in (by
command line flag or configuration option).


### libtorrent metrics in Deluge 2
Once Deluge 2 is released, the libtorrent metrics need to be updated to expose the
newer [performance/statistics counters](https://www.libtorrent.org/manual-ref.html#session-statistics).

Deluge 1.3.x only exposes the statistics provided by the deprecated
`session_get_status()`.

## Docker

A docker image is [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tobbez/deluge_exporter/).

It currently requires passing the deluge config directory into the container, [for example](https://github.com/tobbez/deluge_exporter/pull/1#issue-229784499):

```
docker run -e "DELUGE_HOST=172.17.0.1" -v /etc/deluge:/root/.config/deluge/ -p 9354:9354 tobbez/deluge_exporter:latest
```

You probably need to [enable remote connections](https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/UserGuide/ThinClient#EnableRemoteConnection)!
